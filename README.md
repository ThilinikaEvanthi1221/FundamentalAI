AI Study Guide — Vite + React + Tailwind

Quick start:

1. Open a terminal in the project folder.

2. Install dependencies:

```
npm install
```

(If you prefer yarn: `yarn`)

3. Run the dev server:

```
npm run dev
```

4. Open the printed local URL (usually http://localhost:5173).

Notes:

- The project uses Tailwind for styling and `lucide-react` for icons.
- If Tailwind classes don't render until after install, ensure you ran `npm install` and restarted the dev server.
- To include the full study content, replace the shortened `sections` placeholder in `src/components/StudyGuide.jsx` with your full `sections` object.
